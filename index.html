        <h3>What is FreedomSponsors.</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.freedomsponsors.org">FreedomSponsors</a> is a crowdfunding platform for open source projects, specifically, open source project's <em>issues</em>.</p>

<p>Anyone can go and place a bounty for an issue they need.
If more people need it, thay can "chip in" and the bounties add up. </p>

<p>It's like JIRA's voting system, but the votes come with a "money offer" attached. 
Developers then can resolve the issues and claim their prizes. </p>

<p>The sponsors are notified and pay - <em>if</em> they're happy with the result.</p>

<p>You can think of FS as a big online board for WANTED signs like in the wild west movies :-)</p>

<p><img src="http://freedomsponsors.github.com/www.freedomsponsors.org/bug_wanted2.png" alt="bug - WANTED"></p>

<p>FreedomSponsors is <a href="http://github.com/freedomsponsors">open source</a> on Github (and help is welcome). 
Feel free to browse (or add issues to) our <a href="https://github.com/freedomsponsors/www.freedomsponsors.org/issues">issue tracker</a> or leave us some <a href="http://www.freedomsponsors.org/core/feedback">feedback</a>.</p>

<h3>How to use it.</h3>

<p>Whether you want to place a bounty or begin working on issues, first you need to sign up. 
Currently, the only way to sign up is using a GMail account (but we'll add more methods soon).</p>

<p>Place new bounties by clicking on "Sponsor new issue", or join other sponsors on existing bounties by clicking "Sponsor this issue" on the issue page. </p>

<p>When placing a new bounty, you need to provide the "original" issue URL, like "<a href="https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HHH-1050">https://hibernate.onjira.com/browse/HHH-1050</a>". FS will try to discover a few issue details, like issue key, title and project - so you don't have to type those yourself.
You also specify a few acceptance criteria: </p>

<ul>
<li>requirements (free text),</li>
<li>expiration date, </li>
<li>"no forking" (checkbox), and </li>
<li>"require release" (checkbox).</li>
</ul><p>When you finish placing your bounty, you get a popup reminder that you have to let the developers know about it. And the best way to do that is to visit the original issue URL and drop a comment with a link to the bounty you just created.</p>

<p>When a developer starts working on an issue, he can let everyone know by clicking "Work on this issue" (the developer will nedd a FS account too, of course). The sponsors are notified by email - and they are also notified when the developer clicks the "Resolve issue" button.</p>

<p>The sponsors can verify whether their problem is really gone, and pay if they're happy with the result. Or just don't otherwise. </p>

<p>This is important: <em>there is nothing on the system that forces nobody to pay anything</em>. There are no escrows and no pre paid credits - this is not an implementation detail - it's by philosophy. </p>

<p>The whole thing is voluntary to begin with. We want sponsors to pay the developers <em>because they feel grateful for their work</em>, and only after their problem is actually solved.</p>

<h3>Payment.</h3>

<p>Currently, the only supported payment method is Paypal. We charge a 3% fee out of the developer's pay (to cover hosting and other expenses). </p>

<p>We use Paypal's <em>Parallel payment</em> type. On a parallel payment, an account A can make a single payment that will be split to two or more receiver accounts.</p>

<p>Suppose a sponsor wants to pay his U$ 10 bounty to two developers, and the sponsor decides that she will give U$5 to each. On the payment page (on Paypal's website), the sponsor will see:</p>

<pre><code>  - Developer A ......... U$ 4.85
  - Developer B ......... U$ 4.85
  - FREEDOMSPONSORS ..... U$ 0.30
</code></pre>

<p>Paypal's fees will also aplly to all three receivers.</p>

<h3>Spreading the word</h3>

<p>We believe that if this model really catches, it might have a huge positive impact on open source projects.</p>

<p>Developers will be able to spend more time working on the projects they love. Open bounties will make a gentle pressure on projects into making more frequent releases. It's an "everyone wins" world.</p>

<p>We believe we can make that happen. </p>

<p>We want to let the world know that FreedomSponsors is made by developers, for developers. Our biggest goal is to serve the open source community the best we can.</p>

<p>If you love open source too, and you believe that vision, then</p>
