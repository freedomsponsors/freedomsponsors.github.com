FS will try to discover a few issue details, like issue key, title and project - so you don't have to type those yourself.\r\nYou also specify a few acceptance criteria: \r\n* requirements (free text),\r\n* expiration date, \r\n* \"no forking\" (checkbox), and \r\n* \"require release\" (checkbox).\r\n\r\nWhen you finish placing your bounty, you get a popup reminder that you have to let the developers know about it. And the best way to do that is to visit the original issue URL and drop a comment with a link to the bounty you just created.\r\n\r\nWhen a developer starts working on an issue, he can let everyone know by clicking \"Work on this issue\" (the developer will nedd a FS account too, of course). The sponsors are notified by email - and they are also notified when the developer clicks the \"Resolve issue\" button.\r\n\r\nThe sponsors can verify whether their problem is really gone, and pay if they're happy with the result. Or just don't otherwise. \r\n\r\nThis is important: *there is nothing on the system that forces nobody to pay anything*. There are no escrows and no pre paid credits - this is not an implementation detail - it's by philosophy. \r\n\r\nThe whole thing is voluntary to begin with. We want sponsors to pay the developers *because they feel grateful for their work*, and only after their problem is actually solved.\r\n\r\n### Payment.\r\nCurrently, the only supported payment method is Paypal. We charge a 3% fee out of the developer's pay (to cover hosting and other expenses). \r\n\r\nWe use Paypal's *Parallel payment* type. On a parallel payment, an account A can make a single payment that will be split to two or more receiver accounts.\r\n\r\nSuppose a sponsor wants to pay his U$ 10 bounty to two developers, and the sponsor decides that she will give U$5 to each. On the payment page (on Paypal's website), the sponsor will see:\r\n```\r\n  - Developer A ......... U$ 4.85\r\n  - Developer B ......... U$ 4.85\r\n  - FREEDOMSPONSORS ..... U$ 0.30\r\n```\r\nPaypal's fees will also aplly to all three receivers.\r\n\r\n### Spreading the word\r\n\r\nWe believe that if this model really catches, it might have a huge positive impact on open source projects.\r\n\r\nDevelopers will be able to spend more time working on the projects they love. Open bounties will make a gentle pressure on projects into making more frequent releases. It's an \"everyone wins\" world.\r\n\r\nWe believe we can make that happen. \r\n\r\nWe want to let the world know that FreedomSponsors is made by developers, for developers. Our biggest goal is to serve the open source community the best we can.\r\n\r\nIf you love open source too, and you believe that vision, then\r\n\r\n* [Sign up](http://www.freedomsponsors.org/core/login/)\r\n* Spread the word! - (share on [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=369044503149181&link=http://www.freedomsponsors.org&picture=http://www.freedomsponsors.org//static/img/fs2.png&name=Freedom%20Sponsors&caption=Crowdfunding Open Source...&description=one issue at a%20time.&redirect_uri=http://www.freedomsponsors.org))\r\n\r\n\r\nHappy sponsoring!","google":"UA-33169216-2","tagline":"Crowdfunding open source, one issue at a time"}
